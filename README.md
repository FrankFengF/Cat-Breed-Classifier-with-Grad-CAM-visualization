# 🐱 Cat Breed Classifier with Grad-CAM Visualization
This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying four cat breeds—Abyssinian, Persian, Toyger, and Munchkin—using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It also includes Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight the regions of the image the model focuses on when making predictions.

# 🚀 Features
Image classification of 4 cat breeds with ~83% accuracy

Loss and accuracy curves for training and validation sets

Grad-CAM for model interpretability

Discussion of overfitting, dataset size, and performance limitations

# 🐾 Cat Breeds Covered
